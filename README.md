No warants for the code, the calculations and/or formulas are given! Based on the concemporary knowledge, some statistical tests may be deprecated and the default tokenizer may be unsuitable for some tasks as it is based on the .NET RegEx engine. From such a reason, the code is depreacted, please see online autoupdated tools with full description at:
