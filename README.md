## System Requirements
Windows OS, .NET Framework 3.5, optionally: Python, Perl

## Warrants
Use 'as is'. Based on the contemporary knowledge, some of the used statistical tests and-or calculations may be deprecated (and may be prone to the type II error and wrong p-value). The default tokenizer is based on the .NET RegEx engine which may be incompatible with some languages, linguistic approaches and-or theories.
